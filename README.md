# Topic_Modelling_PubMed_Virus_Articles
We will apply LDA to convert set of our research article anstracts to a set of topics.

In thia project, we parse the article abstracts from PubMed with the keyword of human metapneumovirus, zika virus and dengue virus along with their pubmed ids, titles, and publication dates and then apply Topic with Modeling Latent Dirichlet Allocation. 

In order to test it on CPU without an interruption we kept the number of articles limited.
